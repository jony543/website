Chamber music inspired by a painting by Abraham Kritzman

**Program Notes**  
The painting Quicksilver and Tray caught my attention immediately when I saw it at Abraham Krizman's studio. It is a figurative work, but it has no clear perspective or narrative; the characters are detached from one another, though inseparable; and above all, and in between, a deep and bright emotion that cannot be described in words. In my work I tried to find my path through the different parts of the painting, and I chose to focus on the river that runs in the back. This way of thinking led me to choose a rondo form, whose theme is inspired by the river and the different episodes correspond to the characters in the painting. Once I found this system to move my "camera" within the static painting, I felt like I have a good balance between relating to the painting and letting the music flow independently.
