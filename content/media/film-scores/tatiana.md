I was fortunate to be a part of the creation process of this sensitive and meaningful piece from early on. The story of Tatiana moved me to write one the melodies I'm most proud of.

The film was premiered in [docaviv](https://www.docaviv.co.il/2024-en/films/the-life-and-tragedy-of-tatiana-haikin/).
